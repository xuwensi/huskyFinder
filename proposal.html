            <h2>Problem Description</h2>
            <p>
                College curriculum covers a lot of knowledge and requires plentiful effort. Numerous students struggle at the beginning of the quarter from adapting to different courses or professors. Especially at times like now, Covid-19 is affect everyone's life and all classes are offered remotely. It is challenging for all students. During a lecture or a project, most students want a friend to chat with, discuss the material and work on the same thing. Collaboration or help from a classmate can significantly decrease a student's pressure and efficiently learn the material. However, it is sometimes hard for students to find a study partner, group, or project member before or during the quarter. Most students also have no idea how to find people who have taken a class so that they can seek help from them. Some existing attempts to solve this problem only offer study groups but not a mentor. The scope of these applications is usually broad, making it impossible for students to find people who take the same class.

            <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
            <p>
                This application will have the following users: all UW students who are looking for a study partner, group, project member or mentor, and volunteer students who are willing to be a mentor and tutor other students. The users will be viewing the posts other students posted. They can browse over other students' requirements and find a study partner, group, project member, or mentor that meets their needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                The users will need to create an account with their UW email to log into the application. They will be able to type in and search for a class they are taking or have taken. The application will show them all the posts under this keyword. The users can sort the search by relevance or date posted as well. They will then click into a post and see if the student who posts it is the people they are looking for. Then they can respond to the student and also may exchange contact information. If one student finds other students seeking help, they can also be their mentor and help them with what they are confused about. If one student fails to find the information he/she wants, he/she can publish a post with the information. An additional list will also be available for all users where they can see all the posts they published or responded. What's more, there will be a section where the users can keep track of their mentors and who they are mentoring. Other users can also see one's mentoring history, knowing the area the mentor is good at.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The ultimate goal of this application is to serve all UW students and help them adapt to a course by finding a study partner, group, or mentor. This application can help students who are looking for responsible and helpful project members more efficiently. It narrows the focus down to UW students and also restricts that only current or past UW students can access the application.
